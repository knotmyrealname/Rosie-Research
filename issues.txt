Noticed Issues in rosie:
 - Unable to color inner grammar variables in output
 - Unable to use declared grammars in other grammars
 - Parnentheses and bracket usage can be confusing for a new user
 - Managing whitespace can be confusing
 - Recursion is only possible in a grammar declaration
Possible Issues in rosie:
 - Unable to do more complicated matchings efficiently (eg long interleaved tranactions)
   - Might be fixable if we have data structures (should we even do this? might be out of scope)
