The configuration file expects a list of match types, each with submatch types delimited by whitespace-separated strings. Extraneous whitespace (spaces and new-lines) is ignored. An example of a valid config file is:

  all:
  end_line
  invalid_line
  data_line
  tx_begin_line
  tx_end_line
  incomplete_tx_begin_line

  invalid:
  incomplete_tx_begin_line invalid_line

  invalid_sub: data_line invalid_line
  valid: nested_all_tx.complete_tx valid_sub: data_line tx_begin_line tx_end_line

- Note that the data within cannot have the same name as any of the config-type labels (e.g. 'all:')
- It is ill-advised to have duplicate data-labels between valid: and valid_sub: due to the nature of -v output
