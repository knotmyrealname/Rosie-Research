We changed direction partway through, but still keep the papers we looked at for continuations

Rosie is based on parsing expression grammars, of which has some known limitations, so we began the semester
looking at new features that could be added to rpl. We specifically looked at features inspired by continuations.
[]

Before we could test out new ideas, we needed to develop a sample application for the rosie parser. We spent the
remainder of the semester developing a sample problem and a solution in the form of code (rpl and c). What we
learned from solving this sample problem are that there are usability issues with rpl that should be addressed
in a "Rosie 2.0". We've determined a sample application and solution and allow further research to test out ideas
for new rpl features. This allows for future research into continuations or to take a different direction.
tldr:
  - identified usability issues that can be addressed
  - defined a sample problem and solution which make up the base for future experiments


- Include a user guide for the rosie json parser in appendix

- TODO:
  - elaborate on issues.txt
  - iron out rosie json parser
  - create user guide for rosie json parser
